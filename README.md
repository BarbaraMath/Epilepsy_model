# A Computational Model of Epilepsy

### Inspired and built the code from:
`Izhikevich, E. M. (2003). Simple model of spiking neurons. IEEE Transactions on neural networks, 14(6), 1569-1572.`

### The Izhikevich Model
Pulse - Coupled Network:
- Every neuron is coupled with neurons above and below, first and last neurons are connected
- Random distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons
 
 Possible Causes of Epilepsy:
1. Lower threshold for firing: regulated by I parameter in the Izhikevich model
2. Shorter refractory period: regulated by a parameter in the model
3. A high ratio of excitatory neurons to inhibitory neurons
 
_This code was co-created with Christina Bruckmann & Jens Dudink._
